This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on
the Google Play Store Apps dataset using NumPy and Pandas. The dataset
contains information on over 10,000 Android apps, including details like
app categories, ratings, prices, and install counts. The project involves
data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, correcting data
types, and removing duplicates. Using Pandas, we prepare the data for
analysis, ensuring it's ready for meaningful exploration. Then, we
perform various EDA techniques to uncover patterns and trends in app
ratings, prices, and installations, such as identifying the most popular app
categories and exploring the relationship between app ratings and the
number of installs. The insights derived from this analysis provide a
clearer understanding of the Google Play Store landscape, helping to
inform business and development decisions in the Android app market.
